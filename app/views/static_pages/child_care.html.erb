		<h1>COMPREHENSIVE CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - EDUCATIONAL GAMES ROOM</h1><br>
		<h3>What is the current situation? </h3><br>
		<p>
			All children under 6 years are in areas unsuitable for development without care and protection, in need of affection.

During the first three years of life children develop their ability to think, speak, learn and reason. We intend to support the children, focusing on comprehensive care in health, nutrition and education, as well as good treatment, protection, affection, love, care and encouragement.

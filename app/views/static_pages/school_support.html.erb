		<h1>SCHOOL SUPPORT PROJECT</h1><br>
		<h3>What is the current situation? </h3><br>
		<p>
			Many children drop out of school as a result of a lack of care and support or being forced to work.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many children have poor school performance or they just drop out of school because they start to work because they have to support their families, pay their food or their material and school transportation; or because their parents are most of the day away from home for work and can not give the attention they wanted.
		</p><br>
		<h3>The project consists of:</h3><br>
		<p>
			The project helps children to do their homework, to have an adequate study space with educational support, and to receive minimal nutritious meals (snacks) and necessary school supplies.
			In this space the children know their rights and responsibilities, are educated in human and Christian values, and develop skills for self-care against any risky situations.

		<h1>WHO WE ARE</h1><br>
		<p>
			Foundation ‘Bolivia Digna’ started its activities in 2005 and was formally registered in 2006. The institution was created to promote and defend the human rights of infants, children, adolescents, the elderly and other vulnerable, poor and marginalized people. To that end, the work of the foundation has centered around three areas: education, legal assistance and social aid. 
		</p><br>
		<p>
			In 2006 we began work donating clothing and blankets to people living in extreme poverty. We also began educating young adults, indigenous leaders and leaders of social organizations in matters of Human Rights and Responsibilities. 
			We also implemented an education program for teachers, professors and university staff covering human rights and values. 
		</p><br>
		<p>
			As of 2009, Bolivia Digna began work in the following areas: 
			<ul>
			<li class="liili">Design and implementation in schools and churches of strategies for the prevention of violence against children and adolescents</li>
			
			<li class="liili">Protection and free legal defense for children and adolescents who have been the victims of violence. </li>
			
			<li class="liili">Citizenship and community service training for the youth of Cochabamba’s tropical region. </li>
			
			<li class="liili">Social assistance campaigns to assist vulnerable and impoverished  communities.</li>
			
			<li class="liili">Provision of Decent and reasonable housing for families that live in the high-risk zones of Puerto Villarroel, Chapare, and Cochabamba which are extremely impoverished. </li>
			</ul>
		</p><br>
		<p>
			Since January 1, 2015, Bolivia Digna has had a volunteer program for Bolivian and international youth with the objective of establishing and reinforcing a culture of volunteer work and making community service a way of life.  
		</p><br>
		<p>
			Along with La Salle Bolivia (an internationally recognized prestigious educational institution), we run several projects (see projects page for details) focused on childhood development and education for youth in impoverished situations. 
		</p><br>
		<h3>Vision</h3><br>
		<p>
			That people, particularly children, who currently live in exclusion and poverty can be spiritually, materially, physically and socially healthy and that they have the opportunity to exercise their rights freely.
		</p><br>
		<h3>Mission</h3><br>
		<p>
			To improve living conditions and increase opportunities for vulnerable people, particularly children and adolescents, through educational programs, microfinance projects and social aid projects. 
		</p><br>
		<h3>Areas of Action </h3><br>
		<p>
			Prevention and Education: Promotion of a culture of good treatment, respect for human rights and Christian values. 
			Social Aid: Improve life circumstances through better work opportunities, providing nutritional supplementation, and clothing, among other supplies for those in situations of poverty. 
			International and National Volunteer Work: Promote and instill in children and youth of the concept of social and community service as a lifestyle. 
		</p><br>
		<h3>Target Population</h3><br>
		<p>
			The two Childhood Development Centers that we implement in alliance with La Salle Bolivia are located in the neighborhoods of Tackoloma and Mercado Campesino Arocagua—two neighborhoods of moderate to extreme poverty—in the Sacaba District located in the Department (State) of Cochabamba.
		</p>
		<p>
			In these neighborhoods the majority of these children spend most of their time home alone, under the care of older siblings, or they themselves care for their younger siblings. Often times they also spend several hours in the streets. This situation places their health, integrity and development at risk. They also run a greater risk of becoming victims of violence, abuse, and trafficking. 
			The projects directly benefit 180 infants, children and adolescents; 22 mothers and women, and indirectly an average of 90 families. 

		</p><br>
		<p>
			The volunteer program is implemented in the private and public La Salle High School of Cochabamba. In the first session of the program, 34 adolescent students responsibly participated and completed their part in supporting the projects.
